==== About CyanoFactory ====

CyanoFactory is a collaborate research project for design, construction and demonstration of solar biofuel production using novel (photo)synthetic cell factories. 

==== About CyanoFactory KB ====

CyanoFactory KB is a knowledge base that is embracing all data produced by and relevant to the CyanoFactory project partners. 

It is designed specifically to enable comprehensive, dynamic simulations of entire cells and organisms. CyanoFactory KB is currently centered around Synechocystis PCC 6803, an extremely small gram-negative bacterium that is capable of photosynthesis and provides comprehensive, quantitative descriptions of individual mutant strains including: 
- Cellular chemical composition,
- Growth medium composition,
- Gene locations, lengths, and directions,
- Transcription unit organization and transcriptional regulation,
- Macromolecule composition,
- Reaction stoichiometry, kinetics, and catalysis,
- Extensive links and cross-links to all references used to construct each database, and
- Experimental conditions.
